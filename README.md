# HL-Vox-TTS
Takes the VOX lines from Half Life 1 and outputs them as a .wav file as whatever sentence you input

This was written in Python pretty lazily in only a few minutes.
All you have to do to use it is open the voxGen.py file, type in the sentence you'd like and then the program will close.
After it closes it will output a file called "out.wav" with the voice line.

This program also includes the alarm sounds.
This program will not include any words that do not exist in the vox's voice lines.
